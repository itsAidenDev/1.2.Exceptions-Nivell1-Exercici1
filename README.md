# 1.2. Exceptions (Level 1 - Exercise 1)

## Project Description üìÑ

This Java project solves the following exercise:

"Create a class called "Product" with the name and price attributes, and another class called "Sale". This class has as attributes a collection of products and the total price of the sale.

The "Sale" class has a method called calculateTotal() that throws the custom exception "EmptySaleException" and displays "To make a sale you must first add products" if the collection of products is empty. If the collection has products, then it must loop through the collection and store the sum of all the product prices in the totalsaleprice attribute.

The custom exception "EmptySaleException" must be a child of the Exception class. To its constructor we must pass the message "To make a sale you must first add products" and when we capture the exception, we must display it on the screen with the getMessage() method of the exception.

Write the necessary code to generate and catch an exception of type "IndexOutOfBoundsException"."

It demonstrates the use of custom exceptions, collections, and exception handling in a simple sales management system. 

Additionally, the project demonstrates how to handle a built-in exception (IndexOutOfBoundsException) in Java.
